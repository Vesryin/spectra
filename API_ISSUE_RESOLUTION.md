# 🎭 API Issue Resolution & Demo Mode

## 🚨 **Current Issue: OpenAI API Quota**

Your OpenAI API key has exceeded its quota. The error message was:
```
Error code: 429 - You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

## 🔧 **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Fix API Access**
1. **Check your OpenAI billing**: Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Add payment method**: Ensure you have a valid payment method
3. **Check usage**: Review your current usage and limits
4. **Wait for reset**: Free tier quotas reset monthly

### **Option 2: Use Demo Mode (Recommended for Testing)**
I've created a fully functional demo mode that works without the API:

```bash
python demo_mode.py
```
