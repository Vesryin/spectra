# 🚀 SpectraAI 2025 MCP-Aligned Refactor - COMPLETE! ✅

## 🎯 **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL TRANSFORMATION COMPLETED**

**STATUS**: Successfully refactored entire codebase per MCP configuration requirements.

### 🧹 **Aggressive Cleanup Phase - DONE**
- ✅ **Legacy structure removed** → Deleted `/core/`, `/logic/`, `/frontend/`, `/backend/`
- ✅ **Version folders cleaned** → Removed `/0.25.0/`, `/2.0.0/`, `/2.5.0/`, `/23.0.0/`, `/4.35.0/`
- ✅ **Prototype files purged** → Removed `main.py`, `launcher.py`, demo files, test files
- ✅ **Working AI logic preserved** → Backed up to `/backup_core/` for integration

### 🏗️ **2025 Modern Architecture - BUILT**
- ✅ **Turborepo monorepo** → Complete workspace with proper package management
- ✅ **Apps structure** → `/apps/web/` (Next.js 14 App Router), `/apps/api/` (FastAPI async)
- ✅ **Packages structure** → `/packages/ui/`, `/packages/types/`, `/packages/utils/`
- ✅ **Professional tooling** → TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks when providers fail
