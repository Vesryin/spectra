## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Configuration Error" on startup**
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `config/secrets.env`
   - Check that the file is properly formatted

2. **Import errors**
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version (3.8+ required)

3. **Memory persistence issues**
   - Ensure the `data/` directory has write permissions
   - Check disk space for `memory_store.json`

4. **API errors**
   - Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
   - Check internet connection
   - Try a different model (gpt-3.5-turbo vs gpt-4)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting in `config/secrets.env`:
```env
DEBUG=True
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

Logs are written to `data/spectra.log`.
